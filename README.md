# hashcode18
Code of the Caramelos Tide Pods team at Hashcode 2018, on the Zaragoza Hub.  

We choose a solutionj based on the Matlab framework, because a class aproach seems to difficult to program in such short time.
The calcs were matrix based were aplicable and if time allowed for it.  

There are two functions but the main just ask for a '.in' file and a seed just in case you are iterating to find another solution.
